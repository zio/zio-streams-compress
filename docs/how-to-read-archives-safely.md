Reading an archive means reading entries that someone else may have written. This guide shows how to read entry contents without losing data, and how to stop an entry that is too large before it fills the memory.

## Read Each Entry Before the Next One

Every unarchiver in this library emits entries in a streaming fashion. The content of an entry is a stream that reads from the archive directly. When you move on to the next entry without reading the current content, the pipeline waits for that content to be read. Nothing reads it, so the pipeline never continues. The program locks up and halts without an error.

For that reason, read each entry's content completely before the next entry is emitted. The simplest way is to run the content stream inside the `mapZIO` that handles the entry:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.compress._
import zio.stream._

val printSizes =
  ZStream
    .fromFileName("archive.zip")
    .via(ZipUnarchiver().unarchive)
    .mapZIO { case (archiveEntry, contentStream) =>
      contentStream.runCount.flatMap { count =>
        Console.printLine(s"${archiveEntry.name} has $count bytes")
      }
    }
    .runDrain
```

`ZStream#runCount` reads the whole entry and counts its bytes. The next entry waits until this one is finished.

If you only need the metadata of each entry, use `list` instead. `list` reads the content for you, and it fills in the uncompressed size. The same rule applies to all unarchivers.

The rule replaces the behavior of zio-streams-compress 1.x. In 1.x, consuming the next entry, even by accident, corrupted the content of every entry. For example, buffering or rechunking the entries before reading them did that. Since 2.0 the unarchiver reads each entry on demand, so it can keep streaming without corrupting content. The price is that each entry must be read before the next one starts.

## Rechunk, Buffer and Parallel Processing

Some operators need the next entry before they emit anything. Examples are `rechunk` with a size above one, `grouped`, and `zip`. If such an operator runs directly after `unarchive`, it asks for the second entry while the first one is still unread, so the pipeline locks up:

```scala
// Locks up: rechunk asks for the second entry before the first entry's content is read
ZStream.fromFileName("archive.zip").via(ZipUnarchiver().unarchive).rechunk(10)
```

Put these operators after the step that reads each entry's content. `buffer` and `mapZIOPar` follow the same rule: each step reads its entry's content before it returns. Once that holds, the entries can be processed in parallel and in batches:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.compress._
import zio.stream._

val countBytes =
  ZStream
    .fromFileName("archive.zip")
    .via(ZipUnarchiver().unarchive)
    .mapZIOPar(4) { case (archiveEntry, contentStream) =>
      contentStream.runCount.map(count => (archiveEntry.name, count))
    }
    .rechunk(10) // safe: each entry's content was read before its result is emitted
    .runDrain
```

Reading only part of an entry counts as not reading it. If you stop an entry's content early, for example with `take`, the next entry waits forever. The size-limit example below avoids this, because it fails the stream when an entry is too large instead of stopping early.

## Stop Entries That Are Too Large

An archive entry can claim any uncompressed size, and the claim can be wrong. Read at most a fixed number of bytes from each entry to protect the memory of your program. The size reported in the entry header is a hint, so check it and also count the bytes you actually read:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.compress._
import zio.stream._

val maxEntrySize: Long = 10L * 1024 * 1024

val loadSmallEntries =
  ZStream
    .fromFileName("archive.zip")
    .via(ZipUnarchiver().unarchive)
    .mapZIO { case (archiveEntry, contentStream) =>
      if (archiveEntry.uncompressedSize.exists(_ > maxEntrySize))
        ZIO.fail(new IllegalStateException(s"archive entry ${archiveEntry.name} is too large"))
      else
        contentStream.take(maxEntrySize + 1).runCollect.flatMap { content =>
          if (content.size > maxEntrySize)
            ZIO.fail(new IllegalStateException(s"archive entry ${archiveEntry.name} is too large"))
          else
            ZIO.succeed((archiveEntry.name, content))
        }
    }
    .rechunk(10)
```

The first check rejects entries that declare a large size. The second check handles entries that declare nothing, or declare a smaller size than their content. `take(maxEntrySize + 1)` reads one byte past the limit, which is enough to detect an overflow without reading the whole entry.

The `rechunk` after the check groups the entries into batches of ten, so later stages can process several at once. Rechunking is safe here because each entry's content has already been read in full.

## Choose Between List and Unarchive

Use `list` when you need the name and the size of each entry, and nothing else. Use `unarchive` when you need the content. The table shows the difference:

| Method      | Emits                                   | Reads content | Uncompressed size       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| `list`      | `ArchiveEntry`                          | Yes, to count | Always known            |
| `unarchive` | `ArchiveEntry` and its content stream   | No            | Only when the archive says so |

## Notes

- The uncompressed size from the archive header may be missing, wrong, or malicious. Count the bytes you read.
- A failure in one entry's content stream fails the whole archive stream. Handle the error in `mapZIO` if you want to skip the entry instead.
